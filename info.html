      <div class="content">
        <p>This quiz is a 20 question assessment designed to test your ability to distinguish between AI-generated images and real ones. With the rise of AI, it's becoming increasingly difficult to tell the difference, as Large Language Models are able to create hyper-realistic images, audio, and videos. </p>
        <p>The quiz is comprised of hand-picked images chosen from many sources. The AI-generated images used are the result of training on vast datasets containing millions of real images, enabling the models to produce hyper-realistic visuals.</p>

        <p>Once you complete the quiz, you can compare your results to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16760">human average (50%)</a> in distinguishing AI-generated images from real ones. This quiz highlights how you may fare in spotting subtle differences, revealing the growing challenge of identifying AI’s hyper-realistic creations.</p>

        <h1>Risks of Deepfakes</h1>
      </header>
      <div class="content">
        <p>By learning to identify the risks of deepfakes, we can stay ahead of the challenges they may bring.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Misinformation</b> — In addition to becoming more powerful, AI is becoming more accessible. With free-to-use tools like Midjourney and Canva, AI-generated images are easier to create than drawing one. Simply enter what you want to see, and get results within seconds. As such, people have used this to create convincing yet false images to display a narrative other than the truth. This can lead to the spread of misinformation over the internet. This ultimately undermines public awareness of what is the truth or not.</li>
          <li><b>Damaging Reputations</b> — With this unrestricted power, AI can manipulate the appearance or voices of public figures in realistic ways that may damage their reputation. For example, in August 2024, when former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/19/politics/donald-trump-taylor-swift-ai/index.html">shared AI-generated images</a> on Twitter/X falsely claiming that Taylor Swift endorsed his presidential campaign. These fabricated images depicted Swift and her fans displaying support for Trump, leading to widespread backlash from Swift's fanbase and raising serious concerns about the misuse of AI technology to spread misinformation.</li>
          <li><b>Eroding Trust</b> — The growing prevalence of deepfakes has made it harder for people to trust if what they see online is real. When videos, photos, or audio can no longer be taken at face value, it erodes trust in media and communication channels. This distrust extends to personal relationships, businesses, and institutions, as individuals may begin to question the legitimacy of what they see or hear, leading to a more skeptical and fragmented society.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Resources like Deepfakes Web offer insights into the technology behind these innovations.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>As we enter another technological evolution, digital literacy has become more important than ever to stay aware of what's online.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Navigating the Internet</b> — The internet has now been integrated into our lives and jobs, so it's near impossible to avoid. Digital literacy will equip us with the tools to discern fact from fiction. We can use critical thinking to avoid falling prey to false narratives, which will allow us to still benefit from the internet instead being controlled by it.</li>
          <li><b>Empowering Individuals</b> — Becoming a digitally literate individual will empower you and others to actively participate in a digital society. This will enable all of us to create, share, and engage with content responsibly.</li>

        </header>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Identifying AI-created images and videos requires a keen eye and a solid understanding of common indicators. Here are some tips and techniques to help you spot AI-generated content:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Look For Imperfections</b> — Even though AI Images are becoming more realistic, they often contain subtle flaws. Asymmetric faces, odd textures, inconsistent lighting, or distorted backgrounds are all good tells. Pay special attention to smaller details in the photo like hands, teeth, and reflections. Some common imperfections are below:
              <ul>
                <li><b>Facial Symmetry and Features:</b> Unnatural symmetry or inconsistencies in facial features like mismatched eyes, oddly shaped ears, or incomplete accessories such as glasses or jewelry.</li>
                <li><b>Background Details:</b> AI sometimes struggles to create realistic backgrounds. Watch for distorted patterns, blurry areas, or repetitive elements that seem out of place.</li>
                <li><b>Lighting and Shadows:</b> Inconsistent lighting or unnatural shadows are also a sure sign of AI. This is a know-it-when-you-see-it type of situation. </li>
                <li><b>Fine Details:</b> Check for distorted or incomplete details like unrealistic hairlines, poorly rendered hands, or blurry text in the background.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Look for over-perfections</b> — AI-generated content can sometimes look too perfect to be real. Unrealistically smooth skin, flawless symmetry, or overly vibrant colors can be tell-tale signs that the content was generated by AI.</li>
            <li><b>Reverse Image Search</b> — If you are still unsure, there are many tools that can help you identify AI for you. Use tools like Google Reverse Image Search or TinEye to check the origins of an image. AI-generated images will often lack any history or context, while real images may lead to identifiable sources or photographers.</li>
            <li><b>Use Detection Tools</b> — With the rise of AI, several detection tools and platforms have emerged to help identify AI-generated content. Tools like Hive Moderation or Sensity AI use advanced algorithms to detect traces of AI manipulation.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>By applying these methods and staying informed, you can improve your ability to discern between real and AI-generated content, safeguarding yourself from misinformation and manipulation.</p>

          <h1>Ethical Usage of AI</h1>
        </header>
        <div class="content">
          <p>While AI can pose a threat to our digital literacy, it is still okay to use it responsibly. The following provides some tips to use AI ethically. </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Transparency</b> — If you use AI for work or school, it's important to label it as such. This transparency ensures viewers are not misled and helps maintain trust in a digital world.</li>
            <li><b>Avoid Harmful Intentions</b> — AI should not be used to spread misinformation, damage reputations, or exploit anyone, as we saw with the Taylor Swift example. Ethical usage prioritizes the well-being of individuals and communities.</li>
            <li><b>Promote Accountability</b> — Both users and developers of AI content need to be held accountable for the consequences of its misuse. Establishing regulations and guidelines can help prevent malicious use.</li>
            <li><b>Respect Privacy</b> — AI tools often rely on large datasets, which may include personal information. Promoting ethical AI usage will ensure that privacy rights are respected and that data is collected and used responsibly.</li>
          </ul>
